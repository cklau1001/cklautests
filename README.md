# Background
The repository is set up to capture all cool stuff of what I have learnt. Hopefully, it can also give you some insight when you are stuck during your technology journey.  
It is organized as a monorepo with the sample codes written in different programming languages according to the actual need. For example, Java is used for backend processing and Solidity is used for smart contract development.
