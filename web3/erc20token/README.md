# Introduction

This is a very simple implementation of ERC-20 specification as part of my learning process. It highlights the following important attributes and functions to support fungible coins.

- totalSupply
- balanceOf
- transfer()
- transferFrom()
- approve()
- allowance

Though there have been reusable implementation of this specification, it gives one a first insight how fungible coins works.
